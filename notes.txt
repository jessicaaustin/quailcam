Setting up the Pi
=================


Installing linux

1. Download Raspbian

# go to http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
# and download 2014-12-24-wheezy-raspbian.zip (or the latest)
unzip 2014-12-24-wheezy-raspbian.zip

2. Format SD card with image

# plug in card, then run
df -h  # get mount
# unmount
umount /dev/mmcblk0p3
# format
# (from http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md)
dd bs=4M if=2014-12-24-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/mmcblk0

3. Test installation

plug the pi into the ethernet jack
plug in the card to the pi and try booting up
I had issues with the HDMI out so i ssh'd in instead: use the router admin to get the IP address (or set it to static in the config before plugging it in), then ssh in with pi@IP and password "raspberry"

4. Configuration

# ssh into machine and run
sudo raspi-config

# i ran:
#   1. Expand Filesystem
#   (didn't change the user/pass just yet)
#   3. Enable boot to text console
#   8.A2. Hostname -- changed to quailcam

# then i plugged in the camera and ran
sudo raspi-config
#  5. Enable Camera
raspistill -o test.jpg



Setting up MJPG-STREAMER
